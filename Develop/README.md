## Description

This is a rudimentary game application that allows you to play as a turkey and play a game of tag with other players. The main goal is to catch and turn all the players into turkies before time runs out. It functions as a combination of tag and a zombie game. Possibly a future group project idea depending on the information gathering aquired over the next few months and the man power behind it.

## Installation
You will need to install a few packages. This will use the Inquirer package, some vanilla Javascript, possibly some classes added to improve functionality, and...thats all I can think of for the time being. As stated, this is still in the rudimentary process.

## Usage
You must have a command-line product (Git bach and Powershell are good examples), then run `node index.js` to start the application.
