## Installation
First, you need to install the Inquirer package. To accomplish this, type in "npm i inquirer" into the command line. If there is the case where you do not have npm installed then type in "npm i" so that you can install all the available packages for any other projects that require more than one package.

## Usage
When the application is run by typing "node index.js", there will be a series of prompts that inquire the user about information about their project. Once all the prompts have been answered, then two outcomes are possible: Either the message "README generated!" will appear showing that the file was successfully created, or there will be an error that describes what went wrong during the intializing process.

## Future-Contributions
Currently, there is not much can be contirbuted to the application as of now. However, there can be future suggestions that can be incorporated towards further improving the functionality of the generator down the line. If you have any suggestions, contact me at the email in the contact me section or you can message me on my GitHub homepage.

Simpply type in "node index.js" to test this project.
